# Knowledge-Graph-Multiple-Choice-Generator (KGMCG)
Multiple-choice question generator using Knowledge graphs on the MetaQA dataset

KGMCG generates multiple-choice questions from the MetaQA dataset by generating three distractors or incorrect choices.
The distractors are generated by two approaches - Entity-type Loss Regularization and Contrastive Learning.

The code used in this repository is inspired by the work done by Jin et al [[1]](#1).
